        <h2> Kalyan founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March 2014.
            He wrote a book titled Ism which is also the ideology of the Jana Sena party.
            He met with then BJP Prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and extended his support.
